                Decremental dice' first rolls of the session, unlike incremental dice, start high. However, throughout the session, the rolls progressively get worse. These are favoured among experts in the forms of "gifts for your GM" because no-one wants to use these. These are the second worst dice on this website, with the worst being low.

                To test for decremental dice, roll the d20 5 times and record the results. If the results are high, you have a chance to own decremental dice. Roll the d20 10 more time and record the results. If the rolls progressively get worse, you have decremental dice.

            <p>
                Make sure your dice are, in fact, decremental dice and not heavy dice.
