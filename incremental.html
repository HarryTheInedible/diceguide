                Incremental dice' first rolls of the session are usually low, but then over time become better and start rolling high. These are the fourth most powerful dice on this website and are favoured among dice experts.

            <p>
                To test for incremental dice, roll the d20 5 times and record the results. Should the results start low on roll 1, 2 or 3 and get higher, you have a chance to own incremental dice. Roll it 5 more times. If you see high results that get higher with each roll, or stay around ~14-17, you have incremental dice.

            <p>
                The most optimal way to use incremental dice is to roll out all the bad ones at the start of the session while your GM preps or before the game formally starts.
